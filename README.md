# Smart-Switch
We have made a time-controlled electric socket. The user has the freedom to control the amount of time it wants an appliance to run. Most of the time we experience that we forget to switch of the appliance in time, the motor pump goes on running and wastes water, the mobile battery run hot when we forget to turn off switch, the heating rod keeps on heating water and wastes lot of electricity. Using such switch we can leave our precious electric equipment on work without any fear of there overheating, wire burn wastage any other property hamarage.we can now comfortably switch on the water pump to fill water tank without any risk of overflow and many such problems could be solved. So to solve these problems which in some or the other way harming our pocket we came up with this idea. It is independent electronic equipment which allows current to pass through it only till the time entered by the user.
